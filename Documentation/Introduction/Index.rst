.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
================

The extension integrates `Matomo Analytics`_ easily into TYPO3. The extension
supports Matomo 5.

The extension takes the
:ref:`Content Security Policy (CSP) <t3coreapi:content-security-policy>` into
account: a nonce attribute is added to the script tag, if the feature is enabled
for frontend.

.. tip::
   The :ref:`Matomo Widgets <ext_matomo_widgets:introduction>` extension
   provides dashboard widgets with reports directly in TYPO3.


When to use this extension
==========================

This extension is useful if you want to add further Matomo method calls
dependent on certain conditions â€” such as custom dimensions or setting the user
id. Another option is to enable the `Matomo tag manager`_ and add data layer
variables. :ref:`psr14-events` are available for these purposes. Also have a
look at the :ref:`use cases <use-cases>`.


When not to use this extension
==============================

If you only use Matomo's default tracking code or have only static values
for additional Matomo method calls, insert the JavaScript snippet directly
via TypoScript or the Fluid template.


Limitation
==========

This extension can only embed one tracking code for one Matomo instance. If you
have to add multiple tracking codes for one or more Matomo instances you cannot
use this extension and have to do it on your own.

.. _release-management:

Release management
==================
This extension uses `semantic versioning`_ which basically means for you, that

*  Bugfix updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.0.1) just includes small bug fixes or
   security-relevant stuff without breaking changes.
*  Minor updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 1.1.0) includes new features and smaller
   tasks without breaking changes.
*  Major updates (for example, 1.0.0 => 2.0.0) breaking changes which can be
   refactorings, features or bug fixes.

The changes between the different versions can be found in the
:ref:`changelog <changelog>`.
